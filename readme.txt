The opera. An empty space that can be transformed into amazing new worlds, each time a different one. The singers, actors and audience come together to complete the opera. Yet the foundation remains throughout: a stage, seating, lighting, sound.

And so it is – Opera, a starter theme for [Ghost](https://ghost.org) – received its name. Just like the real place, it contains the foundation you can build upon.
